# Assembly instructions

### 1. Download the STL files and 3D print the case
### 2. Order the materials from the bill of materials
### 3. Open the back cover of the display (Careful when opening the back cover, there is a small joistick connector between the back cover and the front that keep both together!!)

### 6. Use the 3D printed base as a template to drill the holes on the back cover (3mm drillbit)

### 10. Place the boost converter and the driver board on the base (they slide in inside the rails only in one direction until they reach a stop)

### 11. Solder the barrel jack connector into the input pins of the boost converter( We recommend cheching the polarity of the positive (internal pin) and negative pins and cut away the 3rd (sleeve) pin

### 12. Adjust the voltage of the boost converter by connecting the barrel jack to the display power supply and the output to the multimiter terminals, then use a small flat screwdriver to adjust the output voltage to 54V

### 14. Put the top cover of the box inserting first the barrel jack connector through the hole and hold it in place using the nut.


### 6. Connect back the joistick connector

### 6. Connect the backlight connector through the hole on the box

### 6. Add the two self threading screws on the box sides to keep the top in place

### 6. Close the back cover
### 6. Put the switch in (     ) position
